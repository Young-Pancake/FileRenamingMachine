Hello and welcome 
this is an experimental program that may need you to already know things about optical character
 recognition (OCR), and some time to understand most of the code.
 
I have uploaded an INSTRUCTIONS file the contains the instructions on how to use this code and to understand
its parts.

TO EXPLAIN THINGS SHORTLY:
  I have created this program out of the curious thought of replacing a simple yet daunting task of renaming 
  physical or digital messages or letters that may arrive to a certain company and can come in the form of a
 reciept or a bill of sort that may contain any other internal information or any other form of information 
 that a company needs to store somewhere
