## FileRenamingMachine

 A Java program that takes pdf files and renames them based of customizable parameters.

# Motivation

 While working for a job that had too much manual logging of file names by physically 
reading them I thought, "What if you can automate it?" And so here it is!

# Goal

 To be able to automate a specific mundane task(which is manually renaming files), so 
 that you can do something more useful while it runs in the background.

# To get started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Young-Pancake/FileRenamingMachine
cd FileRenamingMachine
```

# 🚀 Quick Start 

TO EXPLAIN THINGS SHORTLY:
  I have created this program out of the curious thought of replacing a simple yet daunting task of renaming 
  physical or digital messages or letters that may arrive to a certain company(or to a person)and can come in 
the form of a reciept or a bill of sort that may contain any other internal information or any other form of
 information that a company needs to store somewhere
