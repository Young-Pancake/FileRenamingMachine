#Hello and welcome!# 

This is an experimental (Java) program that may require you to already know things about optical character
 recognition (OCR), and some time to understand most of the code.
 
I have uploaded an INSTRUCTIONS file the contains the instructions on how to use this code and to understand
its parts.

TO EXPLAIN THINGS SHORTLY:
  I have created this program out of the curious thought of replacing a simple yet daunting task of renaming 
  physical or digital messages or letters that may arrive to a certain company(or to a person)and can come in 
the form of a reciept or a bill of sort that may contain any other internal information or any other form of
 information that a company needs to store somewhere
